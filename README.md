M4 Data 9914D 1/2-inch tape drive

## Doorhinge

The doorhinges are broken, the ABS has become brittle, it looks like its been produced after november 1996, according to the stamping on the other ABS parts.

I've measured the part that wasn't too broken, they seem the same apart from the direction of the steel pin

I've designed a 3D-printable part in OpenSCAD and printed the resulting STL file.
